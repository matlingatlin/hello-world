  deployment + notification tables added, billing deferred to Phase 12.
- 2026-08-07 — Phase 2 app-shell prototype complete: every screen clickable with mocked
  data (projects, create/type-select, wizard + wholeness panel, spec gate, involvement,
  design mode with numbered annotation, build view, reveal + honest status, live feedback,
  versions, ship/export, settings, error & empty states, notifications) -> apps/app/prototype.html.
- 2026-08-07 — Phase 1 (brand) complete: logo (assets/logo/scio-logo.svg, concept B tile
  monogram) and first marketing site (apps/website/index.html). Design tokens already in
  docs/DESIGN.md.
- 2026-08-07 — Phase 0.2 stack decisions: cloud Azure (ADR-0004), sandbox ACA dynamic
  sessions (ADR-0005), backend Node/TS + Python engine (ADR-0006), database Postgres on
  Azure (ADR-0007), auth Clerk (ADR-0008).
- 2026-08-07 — Established the full planning baseline in the repo: repo + docs, CLAUDE.md
  (with the documentation & checkpoint protocol), wedge (ADR-0001), name Scio (ADR-0002),
  visual identity (ADR-0003) + docs/DESIGN.md, the customer journey (docs/UX-FLOW.md), and
  the full build plan (docs/PROJECT-PLAN.md).

### Next
- Phase 3.2: backend skeleton + typed API contract (NestJS), then auth (Clerk) and project CRUD.
